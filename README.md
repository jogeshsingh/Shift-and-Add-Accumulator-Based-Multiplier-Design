# Shift-and-Add-Accumulator-Based-Multiplier-Design
This project includes 4 bit configuration of Datapath and controller of shift and add sequential multiplier design . It was designed in Xilinx VIVADO using Verilog HDL.

#TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. Introduction
Shift and ADD Accumulator based Multiplier design is a RTL level design which incorportates specific logical unit and shift registers and multiplexers . In any Multiplier unit we basically use array of logc gates or array multiplier in which we use some adder units , but that requires a huge logic components and delay gets increased in those type of multipliers . But in this Multiplier unit (Shift and Add logic) , a control unit takes care of sequences of operations which carry out the process of data depending upon the datapath unit.
